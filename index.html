                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create the structure of
                    web pages on the internet. HTML uses elements called tags to define different parts of a webpage such
                    as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, forms and more. These tags help browsers 
                    understand how to display content. While HTML handlers structure, it works together with CSS for styling
                    and JavaScript for interactivity. Every webpage you visit on the internet is built using HTML as its 
                    foundation.

                <p>
                    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the appearance and layout of 
                    HTML elements on a webpage. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, sizes, margins,
                    spacing and positioning. CSS separates the design from the structure, making it easier to maintain and
                    update the look of a website without changing the HTML code. CSS also enables responsive design, which
                    helps webpages adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

                    JavaScript is a high-level programming language to allows developers to add dynamic and interactive
                    features to webpages. While HTML provides structures and CSS provides style, JavaScript controls
                    behaviour. It can respond to user actions, validate forms, create animations, update content without
                    reloading the page (AJAX), and much more. JavaScript runs directly in the browsers and is essential for
                    creating modern, interactive websites and web applications.

                <p>
                    Both id and class are attributes used to identify and style HTML elements, but they serve different
                    purposes. An id is a unique identifier assigned to a single HTML element on a page. It should not be
                    used on multiple elements. A class, on the other hand, can be assigned to multiple elements and is
                    often used when you want to apply the same style or behaviour to a group of elements. id is useful for 
                    targeting a specific element, while class is ideal for applying styles or scripts to multiple elements.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are rendered on a webpage. Every
                    elements is represented as a rectangular box consisting of four parts: content, padding, border and 
                    margin. The content is the actual text or media inside the element. Padding adds space inside the
                    element around the content, border surrounds the padding, and margin adds space outside the element 
                    separating it from other elements. Understanding the box model is important for controlling spacing,
                    alignment, and overall layout of elements on the page.

                <p>
                    Responsive design is a web design approach that ensures websites look and function well on all devices,
                    including desktops, tablets, and spartphones. It uses flexible layouts, fluid frids, flexible images, and CSS
                    media queries to adjust the page's layout and content depending on the screen size and device capabilities.
                    With responsive design, users get an optimal viewing experience no matter what device they are using, which
                    improves usability and accessibility.

                    A programming interface provided by the browser that represents the structure of a webpage as a tree-like
                    hierarchy objects. Each elements, attributes, and piece of text in the HTML document becomes a node in DOM.
                    JavaScript can access and manipulate these nodes to change the content, structure, style, and behaviour of
                    the webpage dynamically without requiring a page reload. This allows developers to creat highly interactive
                    and dynamic user experiences.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    To use CSS in an HTML file, you link an external stylesheet using the <link> tag inside the <head> section 
                    of the HTML document. This allows the HTML to load and apply styles from the separate CSS file. For 
                    JavaScript, you use the <script></script> tag, which can be placed either in the <head> or at the end 
                    of the <body>. This script can reference an external file or include inline JavaScript code directly.
                    Linking these files keeps the color organized, reusable and easier to maintain.

                    Semantic HTML tags are elements that clearly describe their meaning and role within the webpage.
                    Examples includes <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <nav> and <aside>. These tags make the
                    HTML code more readable and meaningful for both developers and search engines. They also help with
                    accessibility by allowing assistive technologies to better interpret the content. Using semantic tags
                    leads to better SEO (Search Engine Optimization), improved user experience, and more maintainable code.

                <p>
                    Centering a div can be achieved in multiple ways depending on the situation. One of the most common
                    and modern methods is using Flexbox. By setting the parent container's display property to flex
                    and using justify-content and align-items properties, the div can be perfectly centered both vertically
                    and horizontally. Other methods include using text-align for horizontal centering or margin auto for
                    block-level elements. Mastering centering techniques is a key skill in CSS layout design.
